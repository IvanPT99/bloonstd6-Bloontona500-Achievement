# Auto Bloons Script

This script automates the process of entering and exiting a career game in Bloons TD6 to unlock the achievement of participating 500 times in the career mode. The script uses `pyautogui` to simulate clicks and the `Esc` key.

## Requirements

To ensure the script works correctly, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

1. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (any modern version should work).
2. The Python libraries `pyautogui` and `keyboard`. You can install them with:
   pip install pyautogui keyboard
